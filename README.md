# Embedded-System-Arduino
During an Embedded systems Module and University we were challenged at turning an Arduino into a smart home device for a selection of devices and functions.

Using C++ i created a smart home device which reads unique messages entered by the user and can create, delete and modify traits of certain devices. Because of the arduinos limited storage the biggest challenge was doing all of this using sensible data structures which were as compact as possible.

This Project taught me to think ahead and to heavily connsider the implications of the code i was writing in the present.
